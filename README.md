## 👀 Overview
⏱ Tick'it is a single page application that allows users to view an array a countdown timers. These timer ranger from US holidays to seasons. 

The purpose of creating this project was to learn more about the front-end framework, Vue. I learned about lifecycle hooks, components, props, the event bus and much more. I am happy with how this project turned out, but I am also looking forward to adding some new functionality once I learn more about Vue!
